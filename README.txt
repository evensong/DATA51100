This repo is for my homework in Lewis University's Data 51100 class.

Code here will demonstrate basic data analysis using Python
(I am using Python 3.8 with Anaconda, currently using vim next to IPython.

Experienced programmers probably won't find anything here, but noobs like me are
free to copy and use what they'd like--please let me know if it's useful and tag me!
