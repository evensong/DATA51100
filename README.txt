This repo is for my homework in Lewis University's Data 51100 class.

Code here will demonstrate basic data analysis using Python
(I am using Python 3.8 with Anaconda, primarily developed in the Spyder IDE. I
may do some projects with Jupyter notebooks for easier visualization)

Experienced programmers probably won't find anything here, but noobs like me are
free to copy and use what they'd like--please let me know if it's useful and tag me!
